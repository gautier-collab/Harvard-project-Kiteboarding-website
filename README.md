Screencast presenting my website: https://youtu.be/Om3hCimgrnY

This is a website about Kiteboarding built as my Project 0 of the Harvard course CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (2018 version). It relies on various features of HTML, CSS, SASS and Boostrap (responsive design, inheritance...).

To visit the website, open the pulled repository in your UNIX terminal and run the following command: 
# python run-me.py
