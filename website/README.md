# Project 0

My project is a website about one of my hobbies which is kiteboarding. The files that constitute this website consist in four HTML pages, one stylesheet in .scss and .css formats and a file named styles.css.map that was generated when styles.scss was compiled into a CSS file. All of the HTML pages are linked to styles.css which uses various features of CSS, Bootstrap and SASS as explained in the screencast describing my project.

Every HTML page has a similar structure based on Bootstrap and includes a section that allows to open any other page of the website. Kiteboarding.html is the main page and includes a picture (as in every other HTML pages), an unordered list, a table and a button “Back to top” to come back to the beginning of the page. As written on the website, the other pages are about some kiteboarding derivatives which are kite foiling, snowkiting and kite landboarding. They contain paragraphs that explain what those sports consist in.
